                <p>There were two principal theories regarding the national sovereignty of airspace:</p>

                    Several principles were adopted by the Paris Convention to ensure the safety of air navigation. These principles included:</p>

            <p>The need for international air law arose due to the <b>growth of international air transportation</b>. The major agreements resulting from the Warsaw Convention included the provisions for the liability of the carrier, the limit of liability, and the jurisdiction for legal disputes. The Hague Protocol and the Guatemala City Protocol amended the Warsaw Convention to update the provisions for liability.    </p>

            There are <b><i> five </i></b>freedoms of the air. The Two Freedoms Agreement allowed airlines to fly over a foreign country without landing, while the Five Freedoms Agreement allowed airlines to land in a foreign country for non-traffic purposes. Bilateral agreements are agreements between two countries that govern air transportation services. Provisions under the Chicago standard form include the establishment of air traffic rules and the licensing of pilots.

            <p>
                The Bermuda Agreement was established due to the need for a new agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom. The United States wanted to liberalize air transportation, while the United Kingdom was concerned about protecting its airlines. The principles established under the Bermuda Agreement included the establishment of air traffic rules and the liberalization of air transportation.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Major changes took place in international aviation during the three decades following the Bermuda Agreement. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) had a difficult relationship with IATA during the 1970s. The British had a problem with the Bermuda Agreement in the late 1970s due to concerns about the rights of British carriers.

            </h2>
            <p>
                The new U.S. policy on international aviation in the late 1970s was prompted by the need for a more liberalized air transportation system. The goals of the policy statement included the promotion of competition, the protection of consumer interests, and the expansion of air transportation services. The International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 established objectives to promote competition in the air transportation industry. Traffic was affected during the early 1980s due to the deregulation of the industry.

            </h2>
            <p>
                An open-sky agreement is an agreement between two countries that allows airlines to operate freely between the countries. Cabotage refers to the right of an airline to transport passengers or cargo within a foreign country. The Commission to Ensure a Strong, Competitive Airline Industry was established to promote competition in the air transportation industry. The "Plan of Action" outlined by the commission in 1995 aimed to promote open-aviation agreements.

               <b><i>Globalization and the Airline Industry</i></b> 
            </h2>
            <p>
                Globalization has had a significant impact on the airline industry. It is difficult for U.S. carriers to establish hubs outside the United States due to regulations and competition. Bilateral agreements between the United States and foreign countries can be disadvantageous for U.S. carriers. An open-sky agreement would improve this situation. Code-sharing agreements allow airlines to share flights and services, but they can also limit competition. The airline industry differs from other industries with regard to globalization due to the unique nature of air transportation.
